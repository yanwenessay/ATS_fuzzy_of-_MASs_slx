This is the application of the ATS fuzzy control method in multi-agents.
This is the application of the ATS fuzzy control method in multi-agents.
The initial parameters have been appropriately adjusted to make the control effect better. 
The ATS fuzzy system still has the robustness of the initial parameters. Please refer to other related papers:
IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, 2024, 22: 944-957.

In the two codes, the systems are different but the controllers are the same. 
Please pay attention to checking my notes (specically in section_6_1.slx) to avoid misunderstanding the codes
